# Introduction

A command line tool for automatically synchronizing the dependencies of a project by the DEPS configuration file.

# Advantages

The depsync tool provides a convenient way to download git repositories and files from the Internet, offering several key advantages over similar capabilities like git-submodules and git-lfs:

- Repositories are always checked out with a depth of 1 without any extra command arguments, ensuring that the main project maintains a relatively compact size at all times.
- Automatically download git-submodules and git-lfs files for your main project and third-party repositories without the need to run commands on each one individually.
- During downloading process, git-lfs files that already exist in the local cache can be skipped. This approach works even for the shallow cloned repositories.
- Enable the execution of custom actions after synchronization. For instance, you can include commands in the DEPS file to facilitate cleaning tasks and other operations.
- Repositories and files can be configured separately for each platform to avoid downloading unnecessary dependencies and only acquire platform-specific ones.

With all the advantages described above, all it takes is one straightforward command `depsync`. Execute it in the root of your main project, and you're good to go!

# Installation

`npm install depsync -g`


## Usage

Run the following command in the directory with a DEPS file:
```
depsync [platform]
```
For example, if you want to synchronize the mac platform, run:

```
depsync mac
```

If you don't pass any platform parameter, it will automatically choose the host platform as the target platform. So the result of running `depsync` in macOS is the same to running `depsync mac`.

The available platform names are defined in the DEPS file, you can also define any other platform names as you want, such as `ios`, `android`... but only the `mac`, `win` and `linux` can be automatically chosen.

Here is an example of DEPS file:
